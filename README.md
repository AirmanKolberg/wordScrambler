I think I may have had a bit too much of the medical cannabis one night a while ago, but here is a script for MacOS X (which leads me to presume that I have another version for Linux on a separate machine) that can just Google a random string of words.  I have no idea why I wanted to figure out how to do this, or what problem I was trying to solve, but here you go.  lol

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!
